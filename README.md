In this project, I used machine-learning algorithms to explore the wind-energy generation data from 50Hertz Company in Germany. The project was developed using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). The project is part of the research effort with CS692-Algorithms for Data Science at Colorado Technical University.

**Tech Stack:** Jupyter Notebook. Python. Numpy. Pandas. Matplotlib. Seaborn. Polynomial Regression. K-Means.
